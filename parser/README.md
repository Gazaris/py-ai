# Parser

In this project I implemented an AI that parces sentences extracting noun phrases.

## Installing dependencies

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python reqs.py
```

## Usage

```
pyton parser.py [filename]
```

## Output

After launch the AI will prompt the user to enter a sentence and after pressing enter the sentence will be processed and the parced sentence tree with all extracted noun phrases will be written into the console. If a filename was specified, the program will take a sentence from it instead of prompting the user to enter a sentence.
