# Traffic

In this project, I made an AI with a neural network that will be able do determine which road sign it is given with a high accuracy based on previous experience (traning data set).

## Installing dependencies

Download an archive from [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/ai/2020/x/projects/5/gtsrb.zip) and unpack it in this directory. It contains the neccesarry data for AI to train. Also install python dependancies like shown below.

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
```
