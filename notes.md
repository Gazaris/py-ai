P(w) - probability of some event w
The probability of some event in the array of all possible events must be equal from 0 to 1, 0 meaning the event can't possibly happer and 1 the event will happen for certain. 
The sum of probabiliies of all possible events in the array must equal to 1.

Unconditional probability - degree of belief in a proposition in the asence of any other evidence.
Conditional probability - degree of belief in a proposition given some evidence that has already been released.
P(a|b) - probability of 'a' given evidence 'b'. P(a|b) = P(a^b)/P(b) meaning probability of 'a' given evidence 'b' equals to probability of 'a' and 'b' divided by the probability of 'b'.

Random value - a variable with a domain of possible values it can take on.
E.g. Roll - variable, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - domain.
Probability distribution - probability for each possible value in a domain (any event in the array).
**P**(Flight) = <0.6, 0.3, 0.1>
P(Flight = on time) = 0.6
P(Flight = delayed) = 0.3
P(Flight = cancelled) = 0.1

Independence - the knowledge that one event occuring does not affect the probability of another.
(The throw of one die does not affect the throw of another.)
If one event is independent from another we can say that
P(a^b) = P(a)P(b), for example the probability of a red die being 6 doesn't affect the probability of a blue die being 6, so the probability of them both being 6 P(a^b) equals the probability of red die being a six P(a) times the probability of blue die being a six P(b) (1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36).

Bayes' Rule
P(a^b) = P(a|b) P(b) / P(a)
