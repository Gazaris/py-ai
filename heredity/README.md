# heredity

In this project I created an AI that assesses the likelihood that a person will have a particular genetic trait.

## Usage

```
python heredity.py data/family0.csv
```
Instead *family0.csv*, you may choose another two that are provided in the *data* directory.

## Output

After launch the program will output the probability of having 0, 1 or 2 genes and having a trait that this gene produces for each person in the chosen table.
